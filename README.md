# Monty - Stacks and Queues - FIFO and LIFO:

This is a simple interpreter for **Monty Byte code files**.

## Learning objectives:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables

## Environment

* Language: C
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
* Compiler: gcc
 > **Note:** The code will be compiled this way: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

## Usage

Usage: ./monty [filename]
```
git clone https://github.com/agusfl/monty.git
cd monty
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
./monty bytecodes/35.m
```

## Description of each file:

| Files          |Desription
|:----------------|:-------------------------------:|
|``monty.h`` |Hold prototypes of functions, libraries, and headers used.
|bf |``brainfuck`` exercises - brainfuck is a esoteric programming language.
|bytecodes |Testing files from Holberton.
|tests |Custom files for testing our code.
|main.c |Entry into program (main function).
|push.c - opcode|Push an element to the ``stack`` or ``queue`` depending which command is given to the interpreter.
|pall.c - opcode|Prints **all the values** on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
|pint.c -opcode|Prints **the value** at the top of the stack, follwed by a new line.
|pop.c - opcode|Removes the top element of the stack.
|swap.c - opcode|Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
|add.c - opcode|Adds the top two elements of the stack.
|nop.c - opcode|Does not do anything.
|sub.c - opcode|Substracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.
|div.c - opcode|Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
|mul.c - opcode|Multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.
|mod.c - opcode|Computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
|pchar.c - opcode|Prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
|pstr.c - opcode|Prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
|rotl.c - opcode|Rotates the stack to the top.
|rotr.c - opcode|Rotates the stack to the bottom.
|stack.c - opcode|Sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO) (this is the default behavior of the program).
|queue.c - opcode|Sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).
